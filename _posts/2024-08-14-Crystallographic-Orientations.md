# Crystal structures
Metals generally have a well-defined crystal structure. This is mainly due to metallic bonding. More details regarding why metal atoms arrange themselves in crystal structures can be referred to here: ---. 

# Origins of crystal orientations
When a crystal structure is oriented in space in a certain way, this orientation in space can be defined by a crystallographic orientation. 
The crystallographic orientations arise, because the crystallographic arrangement of atoms tends to grow in certain preferred directions. 
This is commonly seen in case of single crystals or thin films. Here once the atoms are being deposited, they deposit in the preferred crystal structure oriented in certain specific direction.
